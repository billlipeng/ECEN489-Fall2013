\section{Project Block Diagram}

The project naturally splits along the hardware-software divide.  There are
further natural subdivisions on both the hardware and software components
(Figure \ref{fig:project-block-diagram}).  The hardware is split into three
components --- the analog laser modulation / phase measurement circuit, the
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and its support circuitry, and the
microcontroller that aggregates the information and transmits it to the PC.  The
software can be structured as a pipeline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item decode the ranging and position integration information coming from the
  hardware,
\item transform the measurements from the hardware's egocentric frame to a
  common world frame,
\item visualize the measurements in the common world frame, and
\item (possibly) lift a representation of the scanned object from the common
  world frame.
\end{enumerate}
