= ECEN 489-502 -- Lab 4: Sensing and Actuation II =

== Pre-Lab ==

1) Modify your sketches for both the Light Sensor and Temperature Sensor that you created in the pre-lab activity of Lab 3 to automate the calibration process of the sensors.
Specifically, each sketch should sequentially perform the following tasks:

a)      Prompt the user for input at the console window
b)      Measure the value of the sensor at the condition specified (using the 'enter' key on your laptop)
c)       Store this measured value into the appropriate data type
d)      Repeat for the required number of calibration steps
e)      Use the measured values to calculate the unknown coefficients

== Lab Tasks ==

1) Demonstrate the operation of your sketches using the three known temperature sources for the Temperature Sensor and two known light sources for the Light Sensor.

== Lab Follow-Up ==

1) Modify your sketches to store time-stamped measurements of the calibrated data in a database you create locally.
2) Prepare three suggestions for a system demonstration
